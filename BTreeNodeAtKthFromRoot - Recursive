/*
Given a Binary Tree, Print all Nodes that are at K distance from root node in Binary Tree.
We can also think of this question as Print all nodes that belong to Level K.  

        4
    2        6 
 1   3     5   7
 
k = 1, o/p = [2,6] 
k = 2, o/p = [1,3,5,7]

Do a Pre-Order traversal of Tree and and decrement K each time you move to left or right.
When K = 0, it means that is the level we are interested in. 
So print the Node and return.

        printNodesAtLevel(rootNode.getLeft(), level - 1);
        printNodesAtLevel(rootNode.getRight(), level - 1);
